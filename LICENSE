### Critical Security & Reliability Enhancements
1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never bake secrets in Docker images
   - Use Docker secrets/K8s secrets/vault sidecars
   - `.env` files explicitly blocked in `.dockerignore`

2. **Production Hardening**:
   - Non-root user execution in Docker
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI
   - Resource limits (memory/CPU) in `docker-compose.yml`

3. **LLM-Specific Protections:
   - Input sanitization for prompt injection
   - Output validation filters
   - Fallback mechanisms during LLM outages
   - Cost controls via token limits

4. **Observability Triad**:
